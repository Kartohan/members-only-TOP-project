# members-only-TOP-project

I'm very happy to show my next project! As the assignement says, this is a small and silly application, but thanks to it you can learn a lot! Especially working with Login/Signup forms and with the permissions.

What i used:

1. Pug/Express/NodeJS and Express modules for backend
2. This time i used luxon for date formatting
3. PassportJS with bcryptjs for login/signup forms/ securing passwords.
4. Express-session, passport-session.
5. Using MongoDB and Mongoose for storing data and, important, for storing sessions (connect-mongo module)
6. Tailwind for styling

What i learned:

1. How to implement login/signup into your project with secured "hashed" password.
2. Storing sessions in DB, especially with MongoDB
3. How to let users see what do you want user to see (permissions)
4. Working with dates.
5. Continue working with Tailwind and improve my knowledge.

Things that i need to do:

1. Mobile version of application.
2. Let people get an admin role (now only owner can manually let people become admin)
3. Let people update their messages.
